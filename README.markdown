# About

A sample Java application to demonstrate applying the principles and practices described in Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce book, [Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided by Tests](http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/).

## Disclaimer

This application is built on top of Spring MVC 3.0, Spring Core 3.0, Hibernate 3.5, Velocity 1.6, Sitemesh 2 and Maven 2/3.

I hear people asking, why such choices? I don't pretend these are the sexiest nor best frameworks for doing web development in Java. In fact I don't think they are. I wanted to choose technologies a lot Java developers have to deal (or struggle) with, with the following objectives in mind:

* Make it relevant and useful to a large number of Java developers using open source technologies
* Make the point that technologies should not be preventing you from applying the best practices described in the book.
* Learn Spring MVC myself, after doing essentially rails development recently
* Don't make it too easy, like in real life ;-)

## Getting Started

See the [wiki](https://github.com/testinfected/petstore/wiki/_pages) for information on building and starting the application.
